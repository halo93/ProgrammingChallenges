# Design Patterns
## What is a design pattern?
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code

## How many types of design patterns do we have?
There are 3 types of design patterns:
- Creational Patterns: These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase the flexibility and reuse of existing code
- Structural Patterns: These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient
- Behavior Patterns: These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects

Details of each type will be explained in sub-folders, along with the implementation in Java.
