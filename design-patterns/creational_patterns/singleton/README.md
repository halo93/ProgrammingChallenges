# Singleton
##Definition: 
Singleton is a creational design pattern that let you ensure that a class has only one instance, 
while providing a global access to this instance.

## When to use:
- Use the Singleton pattern when a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients; for example, a single database object shared by different parts of the program.
Other examples in some Java libraries are logging, drivers objects, caching, and thread pool
- Use the Singleton pattern when you need stricter control over global variables
