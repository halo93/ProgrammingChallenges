# Builder
## Definition: 
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you
to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction

## When to use:
- Use the Builder pattern to get rid of a “telescoping constructor” (Constructor with a lot of parameters)
- Use the Builder pattern when you want your code to be able to create different representations of some product (for example, stone and wooden houses)
- Use the Builder to construct Composite trees or other complex objects
